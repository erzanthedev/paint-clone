# 🎨 Paint Clone Project 🎨

Welcome to my Paint Clone project! A paint clone is a web-based application that mimics the functionality of classic desktop paint programs, allowing users to create and manipulate graphics directly in their browser.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I built this project by starting with full HTML for the structure, full CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
This approach allowed me to focus on understanding the logic behind using the HTML Canvas element, which enables drawing graphics using JavaScript.
The project was mainly focused on understanding the logic behind creating a paint clone using the Canvas element.

## 📚 What I Learned

In this project, by usind documentation for Canvas HTML I learned how to implement the following:

- **Setup Canvas**: Initialize the Canvas element and set up the drawing context.
- **Set Color and Range of Brush Size**: Allow users to select colors and adjust the brush size.
- **Draw on Canvas**: Implement drawing functionality to enable users to draw on the canvas.
- **Store Drawings**: Save the user's drawings to local storage.
- **Restore Drawings**: Retrieve and display saved drawings from local storage.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Canvas Element**: Utilized the HTML Canvas element to enable drawing graphics.
- **Drawing Tools**: Implemented tools for selecting colors, adjusting brush size, and drawing.
- **User Interaction**: Handled user inputs to draw and manipulate graphics on the canvas.
- **Storage**: Implemented functionality to save and restore drawings using local storage.
